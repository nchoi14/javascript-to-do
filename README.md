# About my To-Do List
This is a To-Do list website I made for my intro to web-development course at UW-Madison using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

To-Do List Functions:
In this interactive website, titled "Nadia's To-Do List," users can create and title important tasks they need to get done. These items will then appear on the "Pending Tasks" section. Users can rank these tasks in order of importance, edit the contents, mark them as complete, or delete them. Marking a task as complete will then move the task to the "Completed Task" section, where they are able to order the tasks, edit, or delete them.

Contact Page:
The website also features a contact page with a form that users can use to report any difficulties and give feedback.
